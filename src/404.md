Sorry y'all. This site is still a serious work in progress, and many parts aren't finished yet. If you were looking for info about me, I have a [mastodon](https://social.lol/@ewie), a [bsky](https://bsky.app/), and a [wafrn](https://app.wafrn.net/blog/evie). I follow [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) (Post Own Site, Syndicate Everywhere), so my actual site is the real place you'd wanna check. I have [RSS feeds](https://ewie.online/posts/20260214-btw-this-site-does-h/), so make sure to dump this in your feed reader!

If you want to bother me about the site, you can file an issue on [github](https://github.com/qt-dork/ewie.online) and [source.tube](https://source.tube/ewie/ewie.online). Also go there to check the source code. If you want to bother me in general, leave a comment on whatever blog post you want to bothe me on and I'll respond, or [send me an email](mailto:evie@ewie.online).
