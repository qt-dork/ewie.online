  Probably a niche utility card? Derezzing an ice seems good, but I don’t think it’s worth a click, a credit, and a successful run on HQ. It’s one of those cards whose effect is terrible on its own, but gets upgraded to becoming merely okay once you have other cards to extract value from derezzing or rezzing ice.
