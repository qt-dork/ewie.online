  <p>
    Over the years, my blog has become a surprisingly complex application. It’s
    over <span class="spicy">100,000 lines of code</span>, not counting the
    content. Migrating everything over was a big project, but super educational.
    I’ll share my honest thoughts on all of the new technology I used for this
    blog.
