title: Plutus
description: >
  There is no world where Plutus is a mediocre card. There's only two possibilities for it once it hits the table: either Plutus warps the game around it, becoming the main enabler of the corp's current strategy and the number one priority target for the runner, or it is unplayable garbage that requires too much investment for not enough payoff and actively hurts the corp's game.
