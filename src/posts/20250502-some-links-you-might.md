  Heydon’s doing this series where they write an article on every single html element, in alphabetical order. This one’s on the `<body>` element, the one element that anyone who’s ever touched html knows about. This isn’t the most educational resource, but it is heaps of fun, and I think that’s something you can easily forget about when you’re diving into web development. It’s fun!

## Heydon Pickering: [The Body Element](https://heydonworks.com/article/the-body-element/)

Heydon’s doing this series where they write an article on every single html element, in alphabetical order. This one’s on the `<body>` element, the one element that anyone who’s ever touched html knows about. This isn’t the most educational resource, but it is heaps of fun, and I think that’s something you can easily forget about when you’re diving into web development. It’s fun!

## P H Lee: [The V*mpire](https://reactormag.com/the-vampire-p-h-lee/)

A short horror story set on early 2010s tumblr. It’s genuinely really good.

## Talia Fenix: [Steaming a Good Ham](https://www.etymonline.com/columns/post/steaming-a-good-ham)

> The writer of the scene, Bill Oakley, claims it is very unusual and doesn’t resemble any known comedy. He’s wrong; it’s a type of joke that’s old as dirt, going back at least to the Commedia dell’Arte if not to ancient Greek theatre.

This fits into my favorite genre of post on the internet: Someone with a deep knowledge in their field making a good version of something they saw someone else do badly.

## Phire: [Modernity is stupid: A rant not about politics](https://phirephoenix.com/blog/2024-11-05/modernity)

> I’ve been using and ignoring read-later apps since the launch of Instapaper in 2008, because precocious little dorks who cry when they realize that they will never read all the books in the world grow up to be weary adults who transfer that Sisyphean energy to hoarding thought-provoking New Yorker longreads they will also never have time to read.

It’s me. I am a precocious little dork who transferred that energy into hoarding thought provoking longreads. What hits especially hard for me is seeing the birth, rise, and fall of Omnivore from the outside. I wasn’t ever a user of Omnivore (it looked far too much like open source design crossed with a mobile port of a web app, in the worst way possible), but I respected the drive. Something that always came up when I saw people talking about it was, “How are they going to make money?” I guess the answer was that they weren’t.

But despite that, the real meat of the article comes later on. This is the hard-hitting line and the clippable sentence that I probably saw on some other website 6 months ago, which led to me reading the article, saving it somewhere so I would remember to put it in a Link Roundup, and then sharing it with you all today.

> But you know what, I shouldn’t have to understand the business models of every little icon on my stupid pocket supercomputer to get through life!

Speaking of ways our modern condition is dumb, but going in a more endearing direction...

## Mendhak: [I wrote to the address in the GPLv2 license notice and received the GPLv3 license](https://code.mendhak.com/gpl-v2-address-letter/)

This story is silly and I love it. I love that approximately 2/3rds of the article is getting stamps. I love how anticlimactic the ending of the article is. It’s positively delightful.
