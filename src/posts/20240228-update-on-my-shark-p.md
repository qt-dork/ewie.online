  update on my shark pen: it died :( it did kinda refuse to let water in and out when i tried cleaning it. rip i guess but i also did kinda get what i paid for (unsurprisingly a $2 fountain pen works about as well as you’d expect) i do kinda want more shark pens tho because i still like them even though this one broke. i like that they’re a really cheap pen that nobody would steal, but can be freely given away. it’s a really good attribute to have when working in a school
