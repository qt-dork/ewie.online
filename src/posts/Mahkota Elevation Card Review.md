But Evie! What about [Tranquility Home Grid](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/26105)?!

Tranquility Home Grid is almost an exclusively better Mahkota Langit Grid yes, but *everyone* can run Mahkota Langit Grid. This isn’t competing with Tranq, this is giving everyone a 0 influence worse version of Tranquility Home Grid. We’re gonna be seeing a lot of this card in every faction except HB, until Ashes rotates out and then we’ll see it in HB too. Also it can pay for ice which is a nice bonus.
