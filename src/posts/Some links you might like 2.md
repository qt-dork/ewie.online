Hey! It’s time for another link roundup! But first, some housekeeping.

## Cohost Minnesota Wake at Minnehaha Falls at 3pm

That’s today y’all! The link for the wake is [here](https://cohost.org/fraaan/post/7783635-the-minneapolis-st). Please come down! I’m gonna be there! This is just a quick refresher for everyone here to actually go!

## Geoffrey Bunting on the Rolling Stone: [The Digital Orphans of ‘Pokémon’](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/pokemon-digital-orphans-1235123337/)

Honestly, Pokémon is super important to me. Anything that takes a close look at the games will make me feel warm and fuzzy. I *will* use my link shares as an excuse to shove Pokémon down your throat and I will *not* feel sorry about it.

## Studio MillMint: [Photovolumes](https://millmint.net/factbook/society/technology/photovolumes/)

MillMint is a long running website/worldbuilding project I’ve been following for the past 7 years maybe that’s about 40% thinking too much about guns and military stuff and 60% talking about weird fictional versions of things I actually care about. And trains. It recently put out an update about this world’s fucked up computers. Please read about them.

## Eleanor Konic: [On what it means to not have time](https://www.eleanorkonik.com/p/on-what-it-means-to-not-have-time)

> Tim is right that if this were a big enough priority for me, I could get up at four in the morning every day and work in a quiet, locked office with no distractions. I might end up divorced, but I could do it if it was my #1 top priority.

> The reality is that it’s not, and that’s okay.

I’ve spent way too much time in college soaking my brain in some total productivity bullshit, and it’s very refreshing to read a critique of this stuff that approaches it by acknowledging that it’s feasible and would be more productive, but is it a better way to live your life?

## From Jason: [Any Technology Indistinguishable From Magic is Hiding Something](https://www.fromjason.xyz/p/notebook/any-technology-indistinguishable-from-magic-is-hiding-something/)

> The internet doesn’t run on scattered clouds and rushing streams. It takes heaps of fibered glass and twisted steel to send a DM to that cute French boy from your year abroad.

As the saying goes, the cloud is just somebody else’s computer. This essay explores some of the problems that come up when you remember that someone owns that shit and places profits over people.

## Blake Watson: [HTML for People](https://htmlforpeople.com/)

It is an indisputable fact that cohost shutting down meant that a larger portion of the people in my feeds are going to be computer touchers, and that’s really sad. I don’t really know what to do to help with that, but at the bare minimum, here’s a guide on HTML made for people who aren’t computer touchers. I wanna see more of y’all in my feeds! Share your links! The website section in my comments form isn’t for nothing! I actually do check the websites in there!

## Thanks for checking this stuff out!

Once again, come to the cohost wake at 3 pm, and please leave a comment below, or email me at [evie@ewie.online](mailto:evie@ewie.online). And I have a special email for asks at [ask@ewie.online](mailto:ask@ewie.online). Feel free to send some asks and they'll probably show up on the site unless you ask me to not put it there! Just like cohost! See y'all!
