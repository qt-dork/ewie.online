title: Vulture Fund
description: I don't think there's much to say actually. I think this card wants be run as a 1 or 2-of in a decent number of non-bad publicity focused decks, and that means it's a pretty good card. Lots of money y'all. If you want more opinions on bad publicity, please read Veronica's piece on this card and Editorial Division.
