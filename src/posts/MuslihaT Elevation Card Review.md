title: "MuslihaT"
description: >
  MuslihaT is most comparable to Prognostic Q-Loop, since the value is seeing the top card of your stack every turn, and occasionally getting some value from it. I think that’s actually quite good! Occasional free draw is great, and I have high hopes that MuslihaT will be looked upon as the “balanced” version of Hoshiko (They’re both start of turn card draw).

When your turn begins, look at the top card of your stack. If that card is an **icebreaker** or a **run** event, you may reveal it and add it to your grip.

_Peer pressure works._
