We all remember [Reality Minus](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/30051), which has always been here and never been banned ever. Welcome Reality Minus, who, once again, has always been here forever, but still deserves a welcome from time to time.

Anyways Synapse Global is a great concept, managing to twist the concept of rewarding the corp for tagging the runner by focusing instead on the tag *removal* instead of the tag *infliction*. Your reward for removing the tag? [Greasing the Palm](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/34037) with setup on your turn, or a free install (with setup once again) on the runner's turn. While I do think it'll be interesting to see the sort of play patterns that'll emerge from from Synapse Global, I don't think Reality Minus is gonna cut it y'all.
