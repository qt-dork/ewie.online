I’ve been seeing [some](https://blog.dante.cool/link-roundup-6-a-collection-of-cohost-memoriams/) [people](https://jkap.io/link-roundup-for-923/) in my circle doing link roundups, and I thought it’d be nice to join in. I have such a huge backlog of links to work through and maybe this could be a good way to get through all of them. I’m thinking of only doing five links per roundup, but let me know if you think that’s too many or too few. That’s enough waffling for now, here’s the links:

## Austin Walker: [i have been trying to find some words for cohost's final days for about a week now](https://cohost.org/austin/post/7900075-i-have-been-trying-t)

I don’t have much to say here besides wow Austin is really good with words in a way that I am as impressed by as I am envious of.

## Indie Hell Zone: [Tangle Tower](https://indiehellzone.com/2024/10/02/tangle-tower/)

This is just as much a recommendation for Tangle Tower as it is a recommendation for the review talking about it. Tangle Tower is a complete delight, and feels like the closest you can get to a modern Professor Layton. I thoroughly recommend it. Oh and also this review talking about it too, of course.

## iA: [Our Android App is Frozen in Carbonite](https://ia.net/topics/our-android-app-is-frozen-in-carbonite)

I’m as much of an Android hater as the next apple fangirl (they just don’t have the same rich indie scene as apple does, and every android-native app I’ve seen feels like it hates itself), but this whole story about iA Writer’s endless expensive struggle to keep up with Google’s demands all to let Android users write to files in their Google Drive leaves me feeling more validated by that decision than ever. That is, until Apple makes some sort of dumb decision too that screws over its developers. Also, this isn’t the only story I’ve seen this week of someone shutting down their android app because of Google’s weird shifting requirements. [A second developer](https://frozenfractal.com/blog/2024/9/6/why-my-apps-will-soon-be-gone-from-google-play/) has said that they’re also throwing in the towel with Android.

## Laura Michet: [Biking Catalina Island](https://blog.lauramichet.com/biking-catalina-island/)

As someone who has also biked Catalina Island (i was a kid then, so not by choice), there’s so much in here that brings back memories. I’m out here looking at the pictures thinking, “I’ve been here! I’ve seen this!” It’s nice to read a story about someone doing a thing I did as a kid and barely remember so I can be reminded I had a life somewhere amongst the foggy memories.

## Zach Leat: [Eleventy 3.0 is now available](https://www.zachleat.com/web/eleventy-v3/)

This one is for everyone who’s hosting their blog with Eleventy. Version 3.0 just dropped! It’s now made using ES Modules, which is the modern way of being able to import stuff in Javascript. The migration process seems to be pretty simple, and it means you can start sprinkling `import` in your code instead of having to use `require()`. If you want to someone spill ink about its upgrading process, [cohost alumni beeps](https://beeps.website/blog/2024-10-02-the-changelog-eleventy-3-forced-colours-new-art/) wrote a whole thing about its site changelog.

## That’s all!

I had a great time doing this, and I’m really looking forward to the next one. Feel free to leave a comment below, or email me at my new website-specific email at [evie@ewie.online](mailto:evie@ewie.online). Don’t worry, it just goes straight into my normal mailbox I didn’t pay anything for this. I also now have a special email for asks at [ask@ewie.online](mailto:ask@ewie.online), which is an idea I stole from [nex3](https://nex-3.com). If you send any questions in to that email, I will answer them on the site! Just like cohost.
