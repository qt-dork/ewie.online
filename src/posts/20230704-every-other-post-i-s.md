every other post i see in the introductions tag: “hey i guess i have an account here now. idk i might stick around if this place gets more active but who knows. seems really dead here to me tho”

my actual feed: literally flooded with posts i need to unfollow people and clean stuff up because cohost has become too active for my current browsing habits
