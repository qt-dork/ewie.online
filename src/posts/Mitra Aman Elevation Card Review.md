  At the absolute worst, this is a click for 3 credits when you install it and leave it on a server. In a world where Doof at home is slightly weaker, but Corp economy has been gutted, that might be enough to have it see play. Being able to cycle Anemone and do other tricks might be worthwhile. That's fine, but it's odd that most of my thoughts around the Jinteki releases are "wow this works with Anemone" and not proactive reasons to be excited about the new card pool on its own.

Unique Jinteki Upgrade: Clone

Rez cost: 0 – Trash cost: 3 – Influence cost: 2

Whenever the Runner approaches a piece of ice protecting this server, you may trash this upgrade. If you do, gain 3 **credits** and you may swap the ice being approached with a piece of ice from Archives or HQ.

_Spring-loaded minds, kept in suspension to be launched into the net at any incursion._

At the absolute worst, this is a click for 3 credits when you install it and leave it on a server. In a world where [Doof at home](/posts/20250424-transfer-of-wealth/) is slightly weaker, but Corp economy has been gutted, that might be enough to have it see play. Being able to cycle Anemone and do other tricks might be worthwhile. That's fine, but it's odd that most of my thoughts around the Jinteki releases are "wow this works with [Anemone](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/33043)" and not proactive reasons to be excited about the new card pool on its own.
