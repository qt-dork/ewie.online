What is the value of adding the phrase "draw a card" to a card? What I mean is: imagine you had a card that was running a bit weak. How much would it increase the power level solely from slapping "draw a card" to the very end of it? How much value does it give?

In Hearthstone, "draw a card" is worth approximately 1.5 mana,[^1], and something I'd hear is that Blizzard would make a card, realize it was under or overpowered in a way that can't be fixed by tweaking numbers, and would solve this problem by sticking "draw a card" or "discover a card" on it.

Anyways, all of this is a really long winded way of saying that Side Hustle is too weak. The numbers are too small and drawing a card is not enough to make up for it. Maybe it'll see play just because everyone will be too desperate for money with no [Daily Casts](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/26094), but who can say for sure.

[^1]: I can't find a real source for this claim, but I probably heard it from (the Hearthstone player) Trump's Hearthstone card reviews. I was also able to find a source ([How to find undervalued Hearthstone cards automatically](https://elie.net/blog/hearthstone/how-to-find-automatically-hearthstone-undervalued-cards)) which values drawing a card at 1.84 mana. This was released during the first set of Hearthstone, so it makes sense that power creep would lower the cost more over time.
