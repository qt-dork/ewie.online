description: i just rebugged a lot of stuff about social media because social media and the effects of social media are things that i’ve always been really fascinated by. when i was 18, i, in my eternal hubris, tried to design a whole social media app that was meant to be “un-addictive”. the design was bad. it was a lot of mindfulness window dressing on top of a very twitter-brained core, and it would’ve had the same problems twitter had. anyways, my main point is that kind of shit interests me a lot and also i’m a dog bark bark bark bark
