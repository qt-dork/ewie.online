title: anki actually slaps lmao
description: >
    for a long period of my life i would always knock on anki and just say “oh srs (spacex repetition system, not that other srs) will never work for me, i’m just not the type of person for it, sorry.” and then i decided to dig up anki to memorize toki pona vocab, and you know what? it actually works! and it’s great! like it’s so nice to just have something that’s like memrise or quizlet or duolingo except it’s way more flexible and it doesn’t pressure me into paying a subscription or anything. it’s also really forgiving because i’m the one who’s grading my own progress rather than some computer so i can rank how well i’m doing to make sure i keep a steady pace of challenge. i think i bought the ios app for it like once sometime 5 or 6 years ago and i was able to use it and dump my stuff in it and it works completely fine and it’ll probably continue to work fine for the rest of my life and wow. huge props to anki, if you ever find that you need to memorize vocab or anything anki is an easy, fun, and cheap (or free) way to do it. i know this is really long and messy and i’m sorry about that but i have adhd lmao.
