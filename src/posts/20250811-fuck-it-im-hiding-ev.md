title: "fuck it. i'm hiding every mention of ai on my rss feed"
description: |
  here is a list of every muffle or mute i use on tapestry, my rss client of choice. a lot of what i'm hiding is promotions of some sort, usually for members-only content, which i think makes sense. but what has really started crossing the line is stuff talking about ai.

![A screenshot of all my muffles and mutes on tapestry. Most of the mutes are for advertising sponsored content, or actual sponsored content. There is a mute that reads, "I follow this account exclusively for posts on one topic", and a muffle that reads, "Mentions AI".](https://cdn.ewie.online/20250811171222-Image.png)

here is a list of every muffle or mute i use on [tapestry](https://usetapestry.com/), my rss client of choice. a lot of what i'm hiding is promotions of some sort, usually for members-only content, which i think makes sense. but what has really started crossing the line is stuff talking about ai. i follow some normal-ish publications about web dev and stuff, and the amount of ai hype i've seen on the is driving me kinda crazy, so i am now exercising my power to be the god of my own feed and silence it all. it's muffled though because obviously this hides any ai criticism from people i might care about so it's just muffling it, requiring me to click through to see it. tragic.
