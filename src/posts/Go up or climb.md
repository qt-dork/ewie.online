  Here's another piece where I'm publishing work I did years ago explaining entries on the Blaseball Iceberg, which I also made years ago. This one is way up near the top of the iceberg, so it's meant to be really simple to understand. This is good, because I'm not yet ready to explain eDensity.

Here's another piece where I'm publishing work I did years ago explaining entries on the [Blaseball Iceberg](https://cdn.ewie.online/Iceberg%28Iceberg%29.png), which I also made years ago. This one is way up near the top of the iceberg, so it's meant to be short and really simple to understand. This is good, because I'm not yet ready to explain eDensity.[^1]

Since the start of season 2 of Blaseball,[^2] there has been a section of the website titled "The Book of Blaseball" (located under the book tab of the website, of course). Inside is what is supposedly the rules of the game, although they are heavily redacted. Of note is section 5b, which reads "If a team wins three championships, they, and Blaseball, shall ascend." This was noticed by the Society for Internet Blaseball Research, who decided to tweet about this topic at the Blaseball commissioner, at the time Parker Macmillan III, on September 26th, 2020.

After some debate on whether or not Parker had ever actually read the Forbidden Book, he replied with, “uh they go up or climb”, following up with “or like they rise through the air. ‘we had ascended 3,000 ft’”.

Paula Turnip—a fan-run twitter account roleplaying as a blaseball player—noticed a potential source for this particular definition, the Google definition for “ascend”.

This joke eventually even got referenced on the Blaseball website itself. [After the Baltimore Crabs had won their first championship and were set to Ascend](https://ewie.online/posts/20250808-the-funniest-stat-in/), the Shelled One[^3] taunts them by saying:

![The Shelled One saying, "You believe you are worthy to go up? To climb?"](https://cdn.ewie.online/20250826065523-Image.jpeg)

Part of my incentive for reuploading this is because the only source for any of this happening is the original Twitter thread. Twitter—currently X: The Everything App—is no longer indexed on Google or publicly accessible, and is no longer used by anyone who produced or was a fan of Blaseball. A number of former fans have since deleted their accounts in protest, disinterest, or due to general internet rot. Blaseball as a game is surprisingly well archived, in part due to the efforts of people at SIBR putting in the work to create persistent long-term archives of almost every part of Blaseball, including the game, the wiki, and many other parts of fan culture. However, a lot of Blaseball was the experience of being involved in the cultural event that was Blaseball, which has suffered a lot more rot. Part of my hope with this series was that I could help in archiving some of these piece of Blaseball history on a real website. If you would like to read the original twitter thread, you can read it at [this link](https://twitter.com/SIBROfficial/status/1309978895202959360).

[^1]: Please ignore that this is actually below eDensity on the iceberg.

[^2]: It started in season 2 due to an [unfortunate accident](https://www.blaseball.wiki/w/The_Book_of_Blaseball#Opening_the_Forbidden_Book).

[^3]: The Shelled One was the bad guy for the Discipline era of Blaseball, which stretches from season 2 to season 10. This culminates in a big boss fight that happened on day X, which was at the end of the season.
