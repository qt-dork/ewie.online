Iâ€™m in the middle of moving, so Iâ€™ll try to keep this one short, but hereâ€™s links!

## Mikhail Klimentov: [Kill the CEO in your head](https://www.readergrev.com/p/marathon-switch-2-very-serious-business-analysis)

Genuinely though. Iâ€™ve read so much writing about games that just feels like a press release.

## Os Keyes: [Beyond Trans Archives, Beyond Trans Medicine](https://logicmag.io/issue-21-medicine-and-the-body/beyond-trans-archives-beyond-trans-medicine/)

Please, if you only read one thing this week, let it be this. I found it in my read later pile, saved from a recommendation from probably god knows where. Itâ€™s a deep and loving look at archival practices, trans joy, and our relationship with academics. It will leave you in tears.

## Laura Michet: [It's okay to be a certain kind of hooligan](https://blog.lauramichet.com/its-okay-to-be-a-certain-type-of-hooligan/)

> I do not "understand" _getting that mad_ about having to drive slowly behind cyclists for a minute. I never will. It's deranged, murderous behavior. I'm glad to call it criminal.

I love basically everything Laura Michet writes, and this is no different. Read her stuff! Itâ€™s good!

## jergling: [2026: A Tech Odyssey](https://jergling.com/2025/01/21/2026-a-tech-odyssey/)

> You are awakened by a digital chime at exactly 4:00 a.m. Peeling your eyes open, you see the walls begin to shine in a rainbow of RGB waves. Your handheld greets you in Scarlett Johanssonâ€™s voice, through the bedside speakerâ€¦

A short story about the hell-world weâ€™ll be moving towards ðŸ˜”

## wirewitchviolet: [Sudokuvania: Digits of Despair is one of the most impressive works of pure game design I have ever seen.](https://www.tumblr.com/wirewitchviolet/780627633564254208/sudokuvania-digits-of-despair-is-one-of-the-most)

Iâ€™ve been playing a bit of Sudokuvania recently, and it is genuinely impressive how good it is. It is also hard as fuck. I really do recommend it, but please realize you are signing up for many hours of puzzle game where the gameplay is Sudoku. (I love sudoku so this whips to me.)
