Also, just to let you know, this post is going to be mostly pictures, with some
minor commentary attached. Enjoy!

I arrived about 30 minutes early. I left early because I wasn’t certain if
things would go wrong on the train. (Things went wrong with taking the train.)
Since I had some time, I took photos around the park while waiting.

People slowly came in until we were about eight strong. We ate snacks (which I
give a 4/5) and drank flavored sparkling water (which I give a 2/5) and chatted
about memories of cohost. We even got to meet the bug himself! Eggbug was there!
I brought him from my house!

I got to hold Eggbug in front of the overlook for the waterfall. It was very
elegant and I think he really appreciated the view.

Next, all eight of us took a group photo in front of the overlook. Then, we went
down quite the lengthy flight of stairs to the falls themselves. We took another
group photo on a bridge in front of the waterfall.

After that, we walked down the trail from the falls to the beach. Did you know
there’s a beach downriver from Minnehaha Falls? I didn’t.

Once we reached the beach, we got ready for the most important part of the
meetup. This is what we all came here for. (This was not, in fact, what we all
came here for. Going down this trail was done on a whim.)

We did a photoshoot for Eggbug on the rock! I think he looks very handsome and
majestic in these photos.

We exchanged contact information by the beach. This was the picture I took to
remind people who I was in the group chat.

Then it started getting late. We all decided it was time to wrap up and head
out. Since it turned out I wasn’t the only person who arrived by train, all of
us train riders got some food together at Afro Deli on the way back. It was my
first time there and I wholeheartedly recommend it. Would go again.

It was a really nice trip! You’d think I would wrap up a post like this with a
segment about how much cohost meant to me, but what I really learned is that
it’s really nice to meet up with people in real life. Almost everyone was a new
face that I didn’t see on cohost at all, but we all had something in common, and
I had a really good time meeting them. I really want to see them all again some
time soon.

In a way, it’s fitting that the real cohost, and the only cohost I have left now
(besides all the blogs! I love you guys!), is the friends we made along the way.
Although I mostly didn’t make any of these friends along the way, and I only
made them in real life after the site shut down and we all touched grass
together.
