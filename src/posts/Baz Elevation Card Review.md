title: 'Barry “Baz” Wong'
description: >
  This ID is absolutely bonkers good. I swear someone on the NSG team forgot the "Once per turn" flag when finalizing the text on this. But in all seriousness, Baz feels phenomenal to me. Fun fact: you can fit 3x Devil Charm and 3x Arruaceiras in a nice 15 influence. If they rez some ice, you either Boomerang it, or trash it. SDS isn't real, you don't need programs. 5/5 bringing the crime back to criminal was worth it.

This ID is absolutely bonkers good. I swear someone on the NSG team forgot the "Once per turn" flag when finalizing the text on this. But in all seriousness, Baz feels phenomenal to me. Fun fact: you can fit 3x [Devil Charm](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/26068) and 3x [Arruaceiras](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/34073) in a nice 15 influence. If they rez some ice, you either [Boomerang](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/26075) it, or trash it. [SDS](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/26056) isn't real, you don't need programs. 5/5 bringing the crime back to criminal was worth it.
