i write a lot of my post drafts in the app Drafts[^1], but here's some drafts that didn't make the cut or like i forgot or something

i used to have a pretty nightmarish read later system, until kobo said they were going to integrate with instapaper due to the pocket shutdown. then i switched over to instapaper for everything.

# On "This didn't need to be a content warning"

Something I've seen an amount of on Cohost is the refrain, "I hate it when posts use content warnings for stuff that could've been tags", and there's been some confusion as to why. This is my attempt at explaining a few points in favor of avoiding content warnings.

## Cohost has multiple systems of labeling, filtering, and gating off posts. (This is the big one.)

i have no idea what the fuck i was cooking with here. this was written about a year and a half ago, while cohost still existed. reading the other paragraph i had here, right below the crop, it seems to have been a post on how you should just use tags or something. i think i was just annoyed at people using mastodon-style content warnings and wanted to write a big callout post complaining about it. probably for the best i didn't finish it.

# Pocket on Kobo is the stuff of nightmares

Imagine, if you will, being a precocious little kid who loves to read articles on read later apps on your phone. You are also a precocious little kid who loves to read books on an e-reader, which your father let you borrow so you could read every Ender's Game book. One day, you stumble uncross an animal paw, one that feels important and magical. You don't think much of it, but some way somehow, you decide to make a wish. One that holds all of your hopes and dreams, and one that you would soon come to regret. "Gee willikers, I sure do wish that I could read those articles on my read later app on my phone on an e-reader!"

And the monkey's paw curls.

this could've been something maybe but then pocket shut down, showing i was right all along and pocket sucks really bad. i think the inspiration for this was me trying to upload an article from verso to pocket and i literally could not make it work.

 Even basic functionality barely works. The archive button, whose entire purpose is to say "get this article out of my face", no longer gets the article out of your face. It is visually archived at that moment, but it comes back the next time your to-read list is refreshed. It's honestly really dumb.

The read 5 minutes confetti lags horribly for no perceivable reason.

this was when i tried matter after a long break away. matter looks pretty but genuinely sucks, and i was really annoyed at how the core product got so much worse after i was away for so long. if you can't tell, i think a lot about managing and reading links.

anyways that's some drafts! maybe i'll finish some of them, but i'll likely just archive them now that they'll get to live on in some form. thank you for reading and please be sure to comment on which one makes you go like "no wait she's got something there"

[^1]: This is also where I upload a lot of my simpler posts, but that workflow is a post for another time.
