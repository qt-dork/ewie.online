  Okay! That's a wrap! Unfortunately, I didn't write as much as last time (65 reviews to 40 reviews, and I didn't write almost all of the reviews this time), but I still had a great time. My big lesson from this session of reviewing Netrunner cards? Get more contributors and/or bunch things up. There were way too many cards and I didn't have enough to say about all of them.

More contributors would be good. I really enjoyed seeing other people's opinions on the cards, and it would be good to set things up earlier and get more stuff involved, if that sounds neat to people. The other option would be to release reviews in batches almost entirely near launch, where I focus on talking about card packages and faction utility.

Idk this stuff is hard. Netrunner is not an easy game to talk about, although it's a great game to play! [Get Elevation now](https://nullsignal.games/blog/elevation-is-out-now/)! Also please [follow my blog via RSS](https://ewie.online/feed/feed.xml) to continue seeing the stuff I put out! It's only going to get better! Or maybe i disappear off the face of the Earth for another 6 months who knows.
