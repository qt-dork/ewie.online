description: i think the key difference between cohost and twitter is that on twitter i’d follow someone cos they’re influential (to me), and then i’d learn their normal posts are good. on cohost i’ll follow someone because they make good posts that i like a lot and then i find out that they created a game i like or something i use a lot or something like that. this has happened at least 3 times now
