  I’m sorry chat, we’re cooked. We’re so fucking cooked. They printed better Maxx in Jinteki. They get to draw 3 cards every turn and their ID literally enables itself. On top of that, here is every single card that enables AU Co. That’s a lot! That’s some numbers! You only need to proc one of these a turn! And you can stockpile counters! And Your Digital Life is only 2 influence! Literally the only way this deck loses is if Jinteki as a faction turns out to not have the tools to play regular Netrunner.

Jinteki Identity: Division

Minimum Deck Size: 45 – Influence: 15

Whenever you do damage or trash 1 or more cards from HQ, place 1 power counter on this identity.

When your turn begins, you may remove 2 hosted power counters to look at the top 3 cards of R&D. Trash 1 of those cards and add the rest to HQ.

5 stars

If reg Jinteki becomes a thing, this deck will be at the forefront and it will be terrifying. It might still be terrifying anyways.
