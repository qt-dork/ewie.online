  i recently used a free trial for a month of manga up by squeenix and man it’s really bad. it’s so bad that i didn’t even consider the free trial to be good value. they split every chapter up into multiple 10-page parts, to the point that i think i’ve seen some manga go to chapter X.7, which they do because you only get 4 free chapters a day. the translation quality is often quite bad, with some manga having multiple basic spelling errors, including an especially awful “pleas. se.” (or something along thise lines i forgot the exact bubble but it was consistently that bad across the whole manga). it only has 4 main genres on the home page: isekai, fantasy, romance, and other. worst of all was one finished manga that was split into so many sub-chapters and doled out so slowly that the release date for the finale is in 2026. obviously you can just read all of it if you pay such an obscene amount of money that it would probably be cheaper to buy every single volume at the store. what a terrible app. i’d be willing to pay to never need to use it ever again.
