It's been a minute[^1] since the last link roundup! Since I've got the new more convenient writing flow, I thought it’d be nice to actually use this to get back to doing these again!

## Gobolatula: [Please Forgive Me!!!](https://gobolatula.com/pfm/comic/chapter-one-pleased-to-meet-you/)

I’m starting this off with a whole-hearted recommendation of Please Forgive Me!!! It’s the sorta-sequel sorta-reboot of my favorite webcomic, [It Hurts!!](https://gobolatula.com/ithurts/), and It’s genuinely so fucking good. 

## Butterfree: [When Rumours Come True: The Mew Trick](https://www.dragonflycave.com/essays/the-mew-trick)

As someone who never had a point in my life where the Mew trick was anything other than something people used to show how glitchy gen 1 was, it’s really nice to read the experiences of someone who was on the ground floor for it.

## Anna Dana Hudson: [Any Percent](https://giganotosaurus.org/2023/05/01/any-percent/)

I think this one made the rounds on cohost way back in the day, but I finally read it recently and holy hell this is good.

## Sciman101: [A Price of Commodity](https://sciman.info/blog/a-price-of-commodity/)

> Nothing, absolutely nothing, didn't have a human involved in the creation process at some point.

This post from cohost alumni Sciman101 is a good reminder that, all those things you have? People made them. Even the cheap things. Refreshing to see someone point out the humanity in a world where corporations want more and more products to seem like they appeared whole cloth out of the void.

## Kōdō Simone: [What if we made advertising illegal?](https://simone.org/advertising/)

What if tho? Wouldn’t that be awesome or what?
