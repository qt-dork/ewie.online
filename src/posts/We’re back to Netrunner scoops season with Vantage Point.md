  Welcome back to Netrunner scoops season! This one is gonna start low and slow, since [Vantage Point](https://nullsignal.games/blog/announcing-vantage-point/) isn't going to be out until Q1 2026. As per usual, I will be trying to review as many cards as I can until the set finally comes out. Here's hoping I can review them all.

However, there is a catch this year. This will be my first set of card reviews since I've started volunteering at Null Signal Games. While it is very exciting for me to help work at the organization that makes my favorite card game, this still carries some risks. Not to get too inside baseball, but I will make sure to try to alleviate some concerns about compromising the quality of my card reviews.

To clarify how much I would know, I am in the web dev team and not in the development team (confusing, I know). This means I don't make the cards, and I don't playtest the cards.  I have seen all the cards (sans art) one time a number of months ago, but I've had no experience with how they will actually play or anything of the sort. Also, my memory is really bad. In other words, I know very little, verging on nothing, and my reviews will still fare about as well as the average person.

My reviews *are still* my pure first impressions, which *will* be proven wrong as soon as the set comes out and I *will* continue to regret my bad reviews as much as I regret having rated [Trick Shot at 2 stars](https://web.archive.org/web/20250107114210mp_/https://cohost.org/ewie/post/5157974-trick-shot).

Hope y'all are as excited for the new set as I am. God I'm so excited to get out of Sable meta.
