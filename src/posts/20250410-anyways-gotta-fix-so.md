anyways, gotta fix some bugs with the attribution at the top of a post. I'm getting the cohost pill avatar on accident.

![Post attribution. It wraps to the next line and looks broken.](https://cdn.ewie.online/broken-attribution.png)

and the tags aren't working as expected. whoops. gotta fix that

![Post tags. They wrap in an unintuitive way.](https://cdn.ewie.online/20250409-Image.png)

on top of all that, a lot of things are Not Great in a "I need to write better code to prevent these issues" way. especially with the css.
