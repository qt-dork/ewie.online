  'Rising Tide is a Shaper card that shapers need to pay influence for. With DZMZ and breakers installed, Principia is functionally a "click to sell to knickknack later" card. Will I ever use this thing to break ice? Almost never, but I see it in a few decks for the econ aspect, being sold later when I don't need duplicate breakers to boost Echelon's base strength or something. That said, don't use this for breaking ice in a faction that has Propeller. It's not worth it. You deserve better.'

[Rising Tide](https://ewie.online/posts/20250316-rising-tide/) is a Shaper card that shapers need to pay influence for. With [DZMZ](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/30022) and breakers installed, Principia is functionally a "click to sell to knickknack later" card. Will I ever use this thing to break ice? Almost never, but I see it in a few decks for the econ aspect, being sold later when I don't need duplicate breakers to boost [Echelon](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/30025)'s base strength or something. That said, don't use this for breaking ice in a faction that has [Propeller](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/33027). It's not worth it. You deserve better.
