title: i’ve been reading a lot about ai art lately
description: and i think it’s interesting how consumable it is. idk all the stuff i’ve read about it tends to have one main takeaway, which is that ai art just isn’t very deep. you can’t really gleam more from it than it presents on the surface. a lot of the writers discuss how even the most evocative ai art simply elicits an “oh that’s really interesting” and then is unable to offer much more than that. idk this’ll prolly become a bigger thing cos i have more to say about this, but for now i’m doing more reading
