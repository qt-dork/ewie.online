description: man there’s some ui things about cohost that absolutely bug the shit out of me and i wish i could sit down and just fix it all even for free, but also i get that there’s only 4 people on the team and the things that make cohost able to survive for longer are probably higher priority. still tho i wish i could just join the team for a month and knock out a bunch of minor ui grievances i have, especially with the new way that the tags work with sharing now i think it’s a good feature that looks not that good idk. still love cohost tho keep up the good work staff
