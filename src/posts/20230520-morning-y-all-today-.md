![A comic where two guys are talking. One of them is holding a phone. Person A: So, my friends and I are working on a startup to fix social media. Person B: No! No! B: Social media is like taking every insight from every philosophical system about thow to be content and throwing it in reverse! B: Trying to fix social media is like trying to fix setting-your-hair-on-fire. You can change who is setting your hair on fire or how much they're setting you on fire but you are still dying! A: What if we encouraged local communities? B, screaming: We had those for free for 200,000 years!](https://cdn.ewie.online/20250903054505-Image.png)
