  I've been shitposting to my local meta about how we're reprinting Building a Better World for Weyland, and I can finally reveal that I wasn't just shitposting. The card draw is just better than a credit in my opinion, and we'll probably see operation heavy decks using Zwicky much more often than we saw Building a Better World.

I've been shitposting to my local meta about how we're reprinting [Building a Better World](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31070) for Weyland, and I can finally reveal that I wasn't just shitposting. The card draw is just better than a credit in my opinion, and we'll probably see operation heavy decks using Zwicky much more often than we saw Building a Better World.
