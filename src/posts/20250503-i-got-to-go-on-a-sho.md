Unfortunately, I forgot my bag at the start of the ride, so I didn’t get to take any pictures during it, but here’s some photos from afterwards. They were grilling burgers and they tasted great.

The ride was about 5 miles and went around the neighborhood, including some brief off-road sections[^1]. There was a second, longer, ride afterwards that I was thinking of doing, but I came mostly for the free tune-up they were offering, which I never ended up getting. The guy doing the tune-ups took a brief look at it before the ride started and said he’d finish it afterwards, but I asked about it after the ride, he said he’d have to put in a work order since they were only doing them for free before the first ride.

It wasn’t really a *huge* deal, but my bike is a $25 craigslist bike, so I can’t justify a paid tune-up that will undoubtedly cost significantly more than I paid for the bike. Really unfortunate.
