title: Key Performance Indicators
description: >
  I don’t think it’s a bold prediction to say that I think almost every Weyland deck will want to run 3 copies of Key Performance Indicators. It is such a cheap and flexible card that even the weakest KPI will still do something for you, and that something will be good.

I don’t think it’s a bold prediction to say that I think almost every Weyland deck will want to run 3 copies of Key Performance Indicators. It is such a cheap and flexible card that even the weakest KPI will still do something for you, and that something will be good.

Also, it can be pulled out of the grave by [Plutus](/posts/20250421-plutus/) to fast advance a 4/2, as if Plutus wasn't already good enough.
