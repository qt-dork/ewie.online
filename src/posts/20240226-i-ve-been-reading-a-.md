  i’ve been reading a bit about ai stuff recently and one thing that has really bothered me is that a lot of people using the framing provided by corporations by calling the problems "hallucinations". they’re not hallucinations. a computer can't hallucinate. these "hallucinations" are caused by the computer being unable to fundamentally understand the world because they can't understand. period. it just bothers me because you're criticizing ai, but you're criticizing it using their language and on their terms and that sucks. don’t play their game and don’t play it by their rules.
