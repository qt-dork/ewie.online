NBN Operation: Double

Play cost: 2 – Influence cost: 3

As an additional cost to play this operation, spend **click**.

Place 2 advancement counters on 1 installed card you can advance. If you do, choose a card type and reveal the grip. Choose up to 2 revealed cards of that type. The Runner shuffles those cards into the stack.

Yeesh. Look at the chin on that guy.

The value of this card is based entirely on if you'd be willing to constrain two of your clicks to "clicklessly" do maybe 2 pseudo-damage to the runner. Is that worth it? Let me tell you: it would be if that 2 pseudo-damage was in any way consistent. Then this could be part of a Measured Response kill combo. Unfortunately, you'd have to be able to ensure that the runner had 2 of whatever card type you're calling out. (How hard could it be? There's only 3 card types in the game!) Outside of that, I don't think this is good enough to see play as targeted hand removal. Very NBN card tho.
