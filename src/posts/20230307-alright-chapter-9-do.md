title: alright! chapter 9 done!
description: that was the shortest and the longest 90 pages i’ve ever read. man i am hyped. really looking forward to what happens next. i know the formatting gets weirder the deeper you get, but also i’m scared about how bad it’ll get (chapter 11 seems like it’s just two columns which imo is dumb)
