title: "Phật Gioan Baotixita"
description: >
  Phat is PE at home as an asset. He'll see regular play in A Teia and Au Co. for sure. With a trash cost of 3, Phat is slightly above the curve when it comes to trash cost, but also isn't particularly scary until a turn or two has passed. Overall, Phat's fine, capably of generating flatlines out of odd angles, and otherwise a good way to hit runner tempo and be annoying.
