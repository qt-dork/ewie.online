description: kinda annoyed that since the tumblr exodus i’ve seen a lot more content warnings on posts that could just leverage the great tag filtering system that cohost has. idk it’s just annoying to have to click through so many content warnings for things as minor as “eyestrain”, “anatomy”, and “eye contact”. like these are things that 99% of people won’t have problems with and the 1% that do can just muffle or mute the specific tag they have problems with. idk just annoying
