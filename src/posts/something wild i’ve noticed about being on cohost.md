title: something wild i’ve noticed about being on cohost
description: i think i’ve actually posted more on cohost than i ever did on twitter. i’d come up with more posts during the day, and just post more times in a day than i did for twitter (on twitter my posting times were measured in days per post instead of posts per day). i think the main cause is just that on twitter i was always worried that any post i’d make would attract the wrong attention or make people not like me, while cohost doesn’t have the numbers or the discoverability to give me those concerns
