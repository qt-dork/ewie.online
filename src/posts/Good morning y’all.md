Good morning y’all. Cohost has now shut down and so here’s my inaugural “I am now posting here and only here” post.

## I’m from the future and I don’t know what cohost is. What happened?

Cohost was a website that ran from 2022 to 2024. It was probably the best social media site ever made, and now it’s gone. Unfortunately, that’s the world we live in now, and so I have to do something new. That something new will be this site! Welcome to Evie On→Line. It’s by me, evie! I live in your computer.

## What’s the plans for the future of this site?

Hoo boy do I have a lot planned. First off, the technical stuff:

- Fix comments
- Add a like button. Don’t worry, it won’t  have numbers
- Make sure the styles are functional. Everything is currently held together with duct tape and a dream and I have enough CSS knowledge to do better than that.
- Improve the markup.

Now, the actual content stuff. There’s a lot in the works:

- Link roundups! I have literally thousands of links saved on different bookmarking services. My goal is to unify them and read them and send the best to all y’all. What’s the point in hoarding links if I won’t be sharing any?
- App reviews. I think a lot about apps and services in stuff. Too much. I didn’t talk about it on cohost enough and I regret not being more annoying about it. It’s all dumb but it’s dumb stuff I care about a lot!
- A certain article I gotta work on.
- General stuff. I have a lot of miscellaneous ideas for things and they’re gonna be posted on here. Ideas are free and I’d be a sucker if I wasn’t taking advantage of that value.
- Posts! I will never stop posting and I’m gonna make sure that holds true here. I’m planning on adding custom styles to posts with certain tags to intentionally style them in a way that’s similar to cohost posts. The posts will still be bad and they still will be aplenty.

Anyways I guess that’s all. Feel free to leave a comment below and you can always email me at [ewie@omg.lol](mailto:ewie@omg.lol). Cohost forever.
