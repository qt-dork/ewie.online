  This has numbers like Drafter but with more punishment if the runner goes tag-me. It's fine, the runner will almost certainly be okay with face checking this once or twice. The art is phenomenal, the name makes me somewhat uncomfortable in a good way, and it's probably going to fight F2P or Tsarevna for slots, but I don't see myself being really excited for this card.

This has numbers like [Drafter](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/26101) but with more punishment if the runner goes tag-me. It's fine, the runner will almost certainly be okay with face checking this once or twice. The art is phenomenal, the name makes me somewhat uncomfortable in a good way, and it's probably going to fight [F2P](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/26115) or [Tsarevna](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/33117) for slots, but I don't see myself being really excited for this card.
