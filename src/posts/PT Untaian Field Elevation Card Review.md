description: >
  This Identity on its own is fine, but with Sericulture, Jinteki's new 3/2, this identity becomes wild. Having the clickless advance means you can score a Sericulture without needing the 3 credits and install click for La Costa Grid. From there the single counter on Sericulture can let you score out a 5/3 with minimal support. I think any PT Untaian will automatically have 3 Sericultures, and the Identity won't see much play otherwise. Can we appreciate the art though? It's my new Jnet background.
