so we know how the comments threads look now, right? like this:

The discussion is just the dialogue of the &quot;I can't believe we're both goth and trans&quot; meme." title="A fake screenshot of a cohost comment thread.

they're great and i love them, but if i may suggest a minor improvement: make it gay.

there's also my attempt at a trans version:

and a lesbian version

here's all the full color schemes if you want them (i truncated some of them to better show what flag it is in a 3 comment hierarchy):
