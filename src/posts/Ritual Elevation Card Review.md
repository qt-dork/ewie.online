title: Ritual
description: >
  With Ritual replacing Diesel, fans of energy drinks everywhere must mourn. For we have lost the baseline Diesel, the only energy drink that can fuel our caffeine jittered runs is Blueberry Diesel. Unfortunately I hate blueberry flavored drinks, so the Diesel that'll course through my veins will be underwhelming in flavor. NSG wasted a perfect opportunity to print Ultra Guava Hype Diesel, or a variety of other phenomenal flavors, and that we instead are stuck with the same tea is a sheer disappoint to me as I grow older and realize my caffeine tolerance is tanking faster than the S&P 500. On a more serious note, Ritual is a fine Diesel replacement if you play it first click. Otherwise it's remarkably mediocre and not worth playing. If you want more reliable "Draw 3 cards", Dr. Nuka is there with charge tokens ready for burst draw. But for those of us used to buying crates of Diesel from our local Costco, we mourn.
