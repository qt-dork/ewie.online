description: >
  I see this falling into a tier above niche utility card. Not high above niche utility card, but I think it’ll see play outside of Anoetic and Skunkworks tech. When? Probably occasionally as a pseudo-Bankhar on servers you know have a barrier somewhere. Also I guess as protection against that new HB identity.

Anarch Event: Run

Play cost: 1 – Influence cost: 1

Run any server. The first time the Corp would end that run, prevent the run from ending unless the Corp reveals and trashes X cards from HQ at random. X is equal to the number of cards in the root of the attacked server.

I see this falling into a tier above niche utility card. Not high above niche utility card, but I think it’ll see play outside of tech for [Anoetic Void](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/30050) and [Manegarm Skunkworks](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/30042). When? Not often, but maybe every now and then as a pseudo-[Bankhar](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/33074) on servers you know have a barrier somewhere. Also I guess as protection against that new HB identity.
