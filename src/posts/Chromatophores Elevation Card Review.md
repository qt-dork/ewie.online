[Arissana](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/34020) got a new toy.

Let’s compare it to [Pelangi](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/26025). is this better than Pelangi? Yes. Pelangi’s once per turn requirement is not ideal, and Chromatophore wants to be slapped on a problematic ice and then you run that server over and over now that you’re free of the burden of having to actually deal with the ice.

Notably, it doesn’t work with [Physarum Entangler](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/34082), since Physarum depends on the ice being *not* a barrier, and not being a subtype other than a barrier. Speaking of which, it’d be nice to have an anti-Chromatophore, which removes all subtypes on host-ice.
