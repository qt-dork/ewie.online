description: hey y’all what’s that one puzzle adventure game that just fucking sucks. the one where you’re given a computer to keep track of little snippets for puzzles you need to solve but it can only hold 10 at a time so you’re still forced to just write everything you come across down and also the combat sucks ass. i can’t find it but i wanna send it to a friend because i think it’d be funny. you have a whip
