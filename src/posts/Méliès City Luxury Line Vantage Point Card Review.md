  Scoring PD is still back baybee! Ikawah Project has been a staple card in scoring PD for about as long as I can find decks of it. (Here's examples from 2021, 2023, and 2024. I have no idea what was going on in 2022.) The only card that's as much of a staple in these decks as Ikawah Project is Global Food Initiative (which might be relevant to my next card review). This might be bringing back enough old tools for scoring PD to make it a top deck in the Vantage Point meta. I know that I'm certainly gonna be playing it.
