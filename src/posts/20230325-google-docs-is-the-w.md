title: google docs is the worst fucking place on earth to put your writing
description: >
  google docs sucks fucking ass like holy shit. it makes me so mad. it feels like every time someone figures out a way to make it more bearable to use, google sits down and concocts some terrible way to make it even fucking worse. google docs is terrible to read in on mobile, and half the time it feels like they cram in an unavoidable ad to download their dogshit app so you can have an even worse experience. but the worst thing about google docs, the thing that's so bad that it made me write this post, is that it doesn't work with read later apps like a half the time. i use readwise reader as my read later app (good read later app, ceo is weirdly into ai tho which sucks, i'll write actual thoughts on it later if y'all really want me to), and sometimes i'll just save something on google docs just because i don't want to read it on google docs, and reader couldn't save any of the content and stored the whole thing as the header image jpeg thing. i don't think this is reader's fault, because most of the time it saves it correctly! this just fucking google docs being google docs and being intentionally hostile to anyone who wants to read anything that's written on google docs! they have to do this shit on purpose it makes no goddamn sense for them to actually think it's a good idea to make their product worse for literally everyone for no reason. and don't get me started on how they fucking ruined the web experience on ipads! when apple changed the way safari on ipads worked so it'd lie to websites to get their desktop version, the first thing everyone thought of was "thank god! i don't need to use the app version of google docs! i can use the web version instead because it isn't fucking terrible!" and years later google managed to figure out how to identify when you're on an ipad anyways to intentionally degrade the experience to punish you for not using their app! and there's banner ads for the google docs app! it's supposed to think this is a mac! what the fuck!

also the font size on mobile is way too small for no fucking reason
