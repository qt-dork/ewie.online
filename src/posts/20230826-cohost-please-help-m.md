title: cohost please help me find a sip alternative
description: so my sip subscription is ending and so it’s yet another time for me to evaluate the state of color picker apps for macos lol. i liked sip because it was fast and precise and easy to use (my favorite feature is that you can click on part of the menu bar icon and it takes you straight to the color picker view since i struggle to memorize global shortcuts), and every alternative i found when i last checked things felt slow and clunky. but sip is just so expensive now and it’s hard to justify this cost for a color picker, so what should i try now? please help cohost
