title: Mycoweb
description: >
  This ice is expensive, expensive enough that I don't think it'll see a lot of regular play. Vampyronassa is the code gate in faction to compare to, and Mycoweb can just genuinely be useless early. It's fine, it'll lead to funny Anemone flatlines from odd angles, and if you can get a Cloud Eater on the board, for the low low price of 18 credits, you too can do 3 net damage to a runner without a decoder. That's some value right there.

This ice is expensive, expensive enough that I don't think it'll see a lot of regular play. [Vampyronassa](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/33109) is the code gate in faction to compare to, and Mycoweb can just genuinely be useless early. It's fine, it'll lead to funny [Anemone](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/33043) flatlines from odd angles, and if you can get a [Cloud Eater](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/34110) on the board, for the low low price of 18 credits, you too can do 3 net damage to a runner without a decoder. That's some value right there.

Honestly, Probably in the bin for me, but it'll be funny when it works.
