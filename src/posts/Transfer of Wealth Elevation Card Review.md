title: Transfer of Wealth
description: >
  All joking aside, I think Transfer of Wealth is even better than the card it's nearprinting, Diversion of Funds. DooF is a 2 click 9 credit swing (net of 4 for you, and net of -5 for corp), while Transfer of Wealth is a 2-ish click 7 credit swing (net of 4-ish for you when factoring in tag removal, and net of -3 for corp) that also lets you access cards.

All joking aside, I think Transfer of Wealth is even better than the card it's nearprinting, [Diversion of Funds](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/21105). DooF is a 2 click 9 credit swing (net of 4 for you, and net of -5 for corp), while Transfer of Wealth is a 2-ish click 7 credit swing (net of 4-ish for you when factoring in tag removal, and net of -3 for corp) *that also lets you access cards*.

I don't know how else to put this, but Transfer of Wealth is removing a drawback people didn't even realize was a drawback. The whole point of these cards is that they're a replacement effect, but I guess we don't really need to think about that anymore.

I'm genuinely thinking that Criminal might be *the* faction to play in Elevation. Null Signal might have overcorrected with this one y'all.
