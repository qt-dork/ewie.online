I made a new system to upload to my blog via drafts. It's really jank and barely works, but that doesn't matter in the face of being able to post worser fasterer. it's like what cohost user @blep said about what cohost user @ewie (that's me) said: [you gotta make it easy to post](https://cloudwithlightning.net/posts/2024/7932696-aw-heck.md).
