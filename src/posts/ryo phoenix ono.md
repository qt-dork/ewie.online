The SBT groundhog saw its shadow and we all know what that means: 2 more years of [Hoshiko](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/26066)[^1]!

That’s right, the ban list for elevation came out and while they thought it was prudent to go for [Creative Commission](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/30020) (valid), [Daily Casts](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/26094) (interesting but go off), and [Moshing](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/26067) (boo), Hoshiko will continue her reign as the de facto best ID in Netrunner until Ashes rotates out I guess.

What does this have to do with the new kid on the block? It means our dearly beloved Ryō “Phoenix” Ōno will probably see about as much play as [Seb](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/34066) and [Esâ](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/33001) do now; not much but still above fringe. It’s a shame because I really love the vibes Ryō is giving off. They’re Anarch ID that rewards you for playing aggressively and tanking ice, and I really like the danger that comes from forcing you tank a to subroutine *and* succeed at the run. Ryō feels like Anarch at its most Anarch. Unfortunately great flavor is still worse than a massive pile of draw that enables whatever strategy you want to do.

If Hoshiko ever gets quick banned for being Hoshiko, Ryō goes up to 4 stars.

[^1]: Oh I just saw in the newest NetrunnerDB update, Hosh now has a toggle to flip the card from front to back. Very cool NRDB, very cool.
