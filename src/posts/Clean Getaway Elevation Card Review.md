  First I want to talk about the art, which fucking whips. The card looks cool, and I’m going to try my absolute hardest to get top 4 at a megacity tournament just so I can own a Clean Getaway playmat. It’ll be peak.

First I want to talk about the art, which fucking whips. The card looks *cool*, and I’m going to try my absolute hardest to get top 4 at a megacity tournament just so I can own a Clean Getaway playmat. It’ll be peak.

What about the card itself? It’s literally [Dirty Laundry](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31037) but in Blue with an additional influence cost if you want to play it outside of Blue. Given the additional influence, it’s probably not justifiable to run out of faction unless you want a run-based econ package. It does make sense why new Dirty Laundry was printed in Crim, since their whole econ suite is mostly run-based.

Will Clean Getaway be good? I mean yeah. It’ll be as good as Dirty Laundry was in Crim. It’s not exactly an exciting rating, but that’s okay. They put all the excitement in the art.
