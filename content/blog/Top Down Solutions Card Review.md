  I really don’t know how to feel about this card. It’s exceptional on turn 1, giving you the entire turn in one click, but I think it’s kind of dogshit outside of turns 1 or 2. I’d ask myself, “Would people be willing to run three copies of this card to maximize their chance of getting a free turn in turn 1?” but the answer is immediately and obviously “Yes”. We’ve seen time and time again in multiple card games that people are willing to trade a lot to get a really strong first turn.

I’m going to remain mixed on this card until it either sees massive play or no play. I’m currently betting on no play, but I’m fully accepting the reality where it’s run in every single HB deck.

Maybe just read [Veronica’s Writeup](https://veronicauntilarkham.substack.com/p/elevation-44-top-down-solutions) on it. She’s got good thoughts on this card.
