I moved to a newer version of Lato that’s a variable font. This shouldn’t mean anything now except maybe a smaller bundle? (Nevermind, see edit.) But down the line it’ll mean some neat things.

Edit: Sorry I just checked right now and the variable fonts are a little over four times the size (744kb for variable vs 116kb for regular. Yikes! This is not  the fault of the variable font for being, well, variable. This is all due to what glyphs it supports! The newer version of Lato supports, just, so many more characters than the original version of Lato. This is kind of a good thing, but it does mean I’ll need to do some subsetting of the font. Speaking of which, I need to write a whole article about that some day. A little introduction to font subsetting that can maybe be useful down the line. Sorry for the massive increase in bundle size, it will be fixed sooner instead of later.
