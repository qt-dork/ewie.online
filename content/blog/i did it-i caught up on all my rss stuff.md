i did it! i caught up on all my rss stuff. i fell behind a lot in september due to cohost shutting down and me having to focus a lot of my work on making my website. i figured out what rss client im gonna use (it’s lire), and i backread on everything added when i added the rss feeds. i’m all good now! things will definitely be good forever now.
