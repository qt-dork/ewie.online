   Cheap facecheck dropped. We’re losing Ice Wall, so this will be appreciated. I have no idea if they’re going to print a replacement for Border Control as well, but cheap ice always see play, and it doesn’t hurt that this is immune to the currently (and likely futurely) very powerful Arruaceiras Crew.

Cheap facecheck dropped. We’re
[losing](https://netrunnerdb.com/find/?q=f%3Aweyland-consortium+b%3Astandard-ban-list-24-12+z%3Arotation-2023+c%2133%7C32%7C30%7C26+s%3A%22barrier%22&sort=release-date&view=list&_locale=en)
[Ice Wall](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31077), so this will be appreciated.
I have no idea if they’re going to print a replacement for
[Border Control](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/28005) as well, but cheap ice
always see play, and it doesn’t hurt that this is immune to the currently (and
likely futurely) very powerful
[Arruaceiras Crew](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/34073).
