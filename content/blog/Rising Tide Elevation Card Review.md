We are entering a post-FFG world, and this makes card reviews really tricky. You
can’t exactly compare cards to the current meta, since so many staple cards are
going to disappear. According to some searches on NetrunnerDB, the card pool
will shrink from
[804 cards](https://netrunnerdb.com/find/?q=b%3Astandard-ban-list-24-12%20z%3Arotation-2023&view=list&sort=release-date&page=1&_locale=en)
to
[447 cards](https://netrunnerdb.com/find/?q=c%3A33%7C32%7C30%7C26+b%3Astandard-ban-list-24-12&sort=name&view=list&_locale=en)
(plus the size of Elevation). 357 cards are leaving the meta.
[(Here are all of them right here!)](https://netrunnerdb.com/find/?q=b%3Astandard-ban-list-24-12+z%3Arotation-2023+c%2133%7C32%7C30%7C26&sort=release-date&view=list&_locale=en)
Obviously, not all of these are good, and there’s a number of repeats or
reprints, but that’s still a lot of cards going away. What will this mean for
Rising Tide? Well…

Rising Tide wants you to be running a lot of fracters. It is most comparable to
[Corroder](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/25010), coming out 1 credit cheaper,
but 1 base strength lower. It comes with the potential upside of gaining more
and more strength as you trash more and more extra fracters, something runners
already want to do since there’s no point in having more than one breaker of
each type on the board. But there’s the question: How many fracters will players
be running in a post-FFG world? Nobody runs more than one fracter in our current
hell-meta, but looking back at slower metas, runners used to run around 2 or 3
copies of a breaker. I think losing around half of the card pool might slow down
the meta enough that Anarch decks will run maybe 2 or 3 breakers, and that I
think will make Rising Tide a compelling alternative to
[Cleaver](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/30006).
