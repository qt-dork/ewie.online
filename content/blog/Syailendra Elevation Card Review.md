   Huh. Weyland is losing only one good code gate, and that’s Hortum. Is this playable over other code gates? I don’t think so. It’ll see play in the sense that every new Elevation card will see play, but I don’t think it’s going to make a splash. Cool art though.

only one good code gate, and that’s
[Hortum](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31076). Is this playable over other
